"""Sector-first, multi-step cascade reasoning: replaces the old single-call
app.analysis.claude_client.analyze_article with a 7-call chain (facts ->
primary sectors -> primary companies -> cascade sectors L1 -> cascade
companies L1 -> cascade sectors L2 -> cascade companies L2). See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-sector-cascade-reasoning-design.md.

All three stage functions below (_extract_facts, _identify_sectors,
_identify_companies) are pure: given a client and inputs, they make exactly
one LLM call and return parsed, validated output, raising on a genuinely
malformed response (no tool_use block). The orchestrator (analyze_article,
added in a later task of this same plan) is responsible for sequencing
them and for the truncate-on-failure behavior described in the design spec.
